This project is a python-based, console application "Meal Picker" that asks you to input two ingredients and outputs a meal that you could make with them! Ideally, you would be able to add more ingredients or meals, depending on how large of a base you want to create. However, this version has just 3 ingredients, and 3 meals.

4 Features I Have Included (noted in code comments where necessary):

*Implement a "master loop" console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.

*Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data.

*Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.

*Additional Feature upon recommendation from Mentor: Stripping whitespace from before/after input
